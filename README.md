### Lru-cold-heat

## What 
#### this is a lru data structure which is implemented by php and inspired by the `Mysql-lru` implementation. it is different from the common lru, because this lru evict the data by the hotness of data, not just the to remove the data by "least recently used.."

## Why
It's just only a interest. when i first to know about it, i cant stop to implement it by myself 😄.

##Final
